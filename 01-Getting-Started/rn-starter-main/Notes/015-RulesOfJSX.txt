Rules of JSX

1. We can assemble different JSX elements like normal HTML
Ex. Wrap <Text> inside of <View>

2. We configure different JSX elements using 'props'

3. We can refer to JS variables inside of a JSX block by using curly braces.
- However, <Text> cannot display objects.

4. We can assign JSX elements to a variable, then show that variable inside of a JSX block.
