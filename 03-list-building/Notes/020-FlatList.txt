The FlatList Element

1. Turns an array into a list of elements.

2. We are required to pass in a 'prop' of 'data' - the array of data that we are going to create a bunch of elements out of.

3. Also required to pass in a 'renderItem' prop - function that will turn each individual item into an element.

4. If you are coming from React on the web, you might be used to 'mapping' an array of data to build a list - FlatList is better with RN
