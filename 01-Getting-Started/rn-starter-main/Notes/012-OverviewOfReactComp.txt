React Component File

* Component files create and export exactly one React Component

Part 1:

Part 2:
Create a component - a function that returns some 'JSX'
JSX - is some special syntax that looks kind of like HTML.

Create a stylesheet (CSS) to style our component

Part 4:
Export the component so we can use it elsewhere in our project
